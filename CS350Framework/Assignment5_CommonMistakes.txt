Assignment 5 Grading Common Mistakes:
Gjk.cpp:
  SupportShape.Support:
    Using floatMin instead of -floatMax
    Not checking in local space
  SupportShape.GetCenter:
    Not checking in local space
  Obb.Support:
    Test all 8 points instead of the optimized support function
  Gjk:
    TriangleRegions:
      Trying to use only the triangle barycentric coordinates
    TetrahedronRegions:
      Not computing all 6 edge and 3 triangle barycentric coordinates
      Using triangle normals for the face regions but forgetting to make sure they point the right direction
    Intersect:
      Not checking against q exactly (shouldn't use an epsilon check)
      Not computing the closest features when separating
