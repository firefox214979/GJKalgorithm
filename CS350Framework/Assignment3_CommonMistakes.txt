Assignment 3 Grading Common Mistakes:
DynamicAabbTree.cpp:
  Insertion/Update/Removal:
    Finding a node isn't O(1)
    Unstable ids
    The algorithm being more than O(n)
  Insertion:
    Not fattening the aabb
    Not rebalancing the tree by checking all parents
    Wrong heuristic (delta surface area!)
  Update:
    Not checking the aabb first
  Removal:
    Not checking up the tree for reblancing (more than one can happen)
  Rotation:
    Recursively computing height or aabbs
  Frustum:
    Not using last axis. Should be stored per node
  SelfQuery:
    Not using a volume heuristic to determine how to "split" nodes
  DebugDrawing:
    Modifying a copy instead of a reference
    Not using level
